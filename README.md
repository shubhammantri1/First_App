# Android
Hello Guys, Here I am Providing an illustration of Button and Toast in Android. 
I am creating an app that shows a message on clicking Button.
# What is Toast??
A toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup. 
It only fills the amount of space required for the message and the current activity remains visible and interactive. 
Toasts automatically disappear after a timeout.

Using setOnClickListener that triggered action which we want(via writing code for that) on clicking button.

Please Correct me I was wrong somewhere.
Thankyou for Reading!
Happy LearingðŸ˜Š!!
